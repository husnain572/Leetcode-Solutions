# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to **LeetCode problems**, automatically pushed via the LeetSync Google extension. It is a personal log of my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** and **problem-solving journey**.

---

## Structure

- Solutions are organized by problem title or category.  
- Languages: Mostly **C++**, sometimes **Python**.  
- Commit messages are auto-generated when problems are submitted.

---

## Purpose

- Track my daily problem-solving progress.  
- Maintain a revision-friendly archive.  
- Prepare for **technical interviews** (FAANG & top companies).  
- Showcase consistency in learning algorithms and data structures.

---

## Progress (Topics Covered)

- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees  
- Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Other DSA topics  

_(Will keep updating as I solve more problems.)_

## Notes

This repo is not just about collecting solutions — it’s about **continuous practice, learning patterns, and improving problem-solving skills**.
